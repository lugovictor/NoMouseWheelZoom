v 1.1
Changelog
Fixed JQuery conflict bug.

This extension disables the annoying zoom shortcut Ctrl + Mousewheel.

For users who rely on the Control key for changing tabs, opening links in new Tabs and using other shorcuts with Control, the sudden zoom of the page gets very irritating. This script disables the shortcut in Chrome.

Compatibility: It works only with Chrome. It fails in the Chromium-browser.
